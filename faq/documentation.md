## The Design of JACK

  * Paul Davis' JACK presentation, Linux Audio Conference 2003. This is probably the most comprehensive overview of JACK's design currently available.

## The Wiki

There is quite a lot of good information on the [JACK
wiki](http://web.archive.org/web/20140209041347/http://trac.jackaudio.org/),
although it is not particularly organized.
