        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A few weeks ago I did a talk/presentation at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sonoj.org/&quot;&gt;Sonoj&lt;/a&gt;,
regarding the past, present and future of the JACK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This talk was live-streamed and recorded, and now Sonoj videos are online,
so you can watch this at &lt;a href=&quot;https://media.ccc.de/v/sonoj2019-1902-jack-past-present-future&quot;&gt;https://media.ccc.de/v/sonoj2019-1902-jack-past-present-future&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>JACK2 v1.9.13 release</title>
        <link href="/news/2019/10/06/jack2-v1-9-13-release.html"/>
        <updated>2019-10-06T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
        <id>/news/2019/10/06/jack2-v1-9-13-release</id>
        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A new version of JACK2 has just been released.&lt;br /&gt;
You can grab the latest release source code at
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jackaudio/jack2/releases&quot;&gt;https://github.com/jackaudio/jack2/releases&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The official changelog is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Meta-data API implementation. (and a few tools updated with support for it)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Correct GPL licence to LGPL for files needed to build libjack.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Remove FreeBoB backend (superseded by FFADO).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;define JACK_LIB_EXPORT, useful for internal clients.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Mark jack_midi_reset_buffer as deprecated.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Add example systemd unit file&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Signal to systemd when jackd is ready.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Set “seq” alsa midi driver to maximum resolution possible.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fix loading internal clients from another internal client.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Code cleanup and various fixes. (too many to mention here, see git log for details)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This release is focused on meta-data support, and this is why it took so long.&lt;br /&gt;
There might be odd cases here and there and a few bugs, as it is often the case
for all software…&lt;br /&gt;
So please make sure to report back any issues!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Special thanks goes to Rui Nuno Capela for the initial pull-request regarding
meta-data.&lt;br /&gt;
There was some work needed afterwards, but that was the biggest hurdle and
motivation needed for a new release. :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are still no updated macOS or Windows builds, those will be handled at
a later date.&lt;br /&gt;
Current plan is to have JACK1 feature-parity first
(only a2jmidid and zita internal clients missing now),&lt;br /&gt;
and afterwards merging examples/tools and header files to be shared between
JACK1 and JACK2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The situation regarding development of JACK and JACK1 considered legacy has not
changed since last release 2 years ago.&lt;br /&gt;
See &lt;a href=&quot;/news/2017/12/21/jack2-v1-9-12-release-and-future-plans&quot;&gt;JACK2 v1.9.12 release and future plans&lt;/a&gt; post for more information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PS: I will be in Cologne for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sonoj.org/&quot;&gt;Sonoj&lt;/a&gt;, giving a talk about
“Past, Present and Future of JACK”.&lt;br /&gt;
There is no registration fee, so please feel free to come by and say hello! :)&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>JACK2 v1.9.12 release and future plans</title>
        <link href="/news/2017/12/21/jack2-v1-9-12-release-and-future-plans.html"/>
        <updated>2017-12-21T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
        <id>/news/2017/12/21/jack2-v1-9-12-release-and-future-plans</id>
        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A few days ago a new version of JACK2 was released.&lt;br /&gt;
You can grab the latest release source code at
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jackaudio/jack2/releases&quot;&gt;https://github.com/jackaudio/jack2/releases&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
The official changelog is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fix Windows build issues&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fix build with gcc 7&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Show hint when DBus device reservation fails&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Add support for internal session files&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you did not know already, I am now maintaining JACK2 (and also JACK1).&lt;br /&gt;
So this latest release was brought to you by yours truly. ;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The release was actually already tagged on the git repo quite some time ago,
but I was waiting to see if Windows builds were possible.&lt;br /&gt;
I got side-tracked with other things and 1.9.12 ended up not being released for
some time, until someone reminded me of it again… :)&lt;br /&gt;
There are still no updated macOS or Windows builds, but I did not want to delay
the release further because of it.&lt;br /&gt;
The 1.9.11 release (without RC label) was skipped to avoid confusion with the
versions.&lt;br /&gt;
So 1.9.12 is the latest release as of today. macOS and Windows binaries still
use an older 1.9.11 version.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being the maintainer of both JACK1 and JACK2 means I can (more or less)
decide the future of JACK.&lt;br /&gt;
I believe a lot of people are interested to know the current plan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, JACK1 is in bug-fix mode only.&lt;br /&gt;
I want to keep it as the go-to reference implementation of JACK,
but not add any new features to it.&lt;br /&gt;
The reason for this is to try to get JACK1 and JACK2
to share as much code as possible.&lt;br /&gt;
Currently JACK2 includes its own copy of JACK headers, examples and utilities,
while JACK1 uses sub-repositories.&lt;br /&gt;
During the course of next year (that is, 2018) I want to get JACK2 to slowly use
the same stuff JACK1 does, then switch to use the same repositories
as submodules like JACK1 does.&lt;br /&gt;
This will reduce the differences between the 2 implementations, and make it
a lot easier to contribute to the examples and utilities provided by JACK.&lt;br /&gt;
(Not to mention the confusion caused by having utilities that work in simlar yet
different ways)&lt;br /&gt;
We will keep JACK1 “frozen” until this is all done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, but not least important, is to get the JACK1 specific features into JACK2.&lt;br /&gt;
A few things were added into JACK1 after JACk2 was created,
that never made it into JACK2.&lt;br /&gt;
This includes meta-data (JACK2 does have the API, but a non-functional one)
and the new internal clients.&lt;br /&gt;
The purpose is to reduce reasons users might have to switch/decide between
JACK1 and JACK2.&lt;br /&gt;
JACK2 should have all features that JACK1 has, so that most users choose JACK2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, you are probably getting the impression that the focus will be on JACK2,
which is correct.&lt;br /&gt;
Though I realize some developers might prefer JACK1’s design, the long “battle”
of JACK1 and JACK2 needs to stop.&lt;br /&gt;
Development of new features will happen in the JACK2 codebase,
and JACK1 will slowly become legacy.&lt;br /&gt;
Well, this is my personal plan at least.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not sure if this all can be done in 2018, but better to take things slowly
and get things done than do nothing at all.&lt;br /&gt;
I will keep you updated on the progress through-out the year.&lt;br /&gt;
Happy holidays everyone!&lt;/p&gt;
